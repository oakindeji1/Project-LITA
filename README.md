## Employee Attrition Analysis

### Objective: Identify factors related to employee attrition (i.e., why employees leave).
### Approach:
- Use Pivot Tables to analyze attrition rates across different departments, job roles, and age.
- Calculate attrition percentage by filtering the Attrition column, and then check for patterns based on age, gender, department, and job role.
  
## Initial Insights from the Data



### Overall Attrition Rate:
- The proportion of employees leaving the organization is noticeable, but the majority are retained. This provides a baseline for further analysis.

### Attrition by Department:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05afcf24-5c0a-4e66-bbab-6751a2e3b6ba)
- Some departments experience higher attrition rates than others. For example, Sales might see more attrition compared to Research & Development, signaling potential areas for targeted retention strategies.

## Employee Satisfaction and Engagement Insights
### Objective: Evaluate levels of job satisfaction and Compensation Analysis
### Approach:
- Use Average and Count functions on satisfaction-related columns (e.g., JobSatisfaction and RelationshipSatisfaction).
- Conditional Formatting can visually highlight satisfaction levels across different departments or roles, helping to identify areas where improvements may be needed.
## Insights from Compensation and Satisfaction Analysis

### Attrition and Monthly Income:
Attrion	Average of MonthlyIncome	StdDev of MonthlyIncome2
No		6832.74				4818.21
Yes		4787.09				3640.21
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71a394ff-e86b-415b-a93d-33dec95135e1)

Employees who leave generally have lower monthly income levels compared to those who stay. This suggests that compensation may be a key factor influencing retention.

### Attrition by Job Satisfaction:

Lower job satisfaction levels are associated with higher attrition rates. Employees reporting high or very high satisfaction are less likely to leave, emphasizing the importance of maintaining engagement and morale.

## Demographic Analysis
### Objective: Understand workforce composition in terms of age, gender, education.
### Approach:
- Generate Demographic Profiles by analyzing columns such as Age, Gender, Education, and Department.
- Use Charts (e.g., pie charts) to visualize age distribution and departmental gender ratios.
- Pivot by EducationField to understand the educational backgrounds of your workforce and how these relate to job roles or satisfaction.

  ### Attrition by Age Group:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feab571c-306a-4e2a-8de2-16178e3f749d)
Younger employees (e.g., 19-34 age group) exhibit higher attrition rates compared to older employees. This trend may reflect early-career exploration or dissatisfaction with growth opportunities.

### Attrition by Gender:
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bac4b0fa-8da1-48e4-ba2e-d0090f08b5ae)
- Employees with bachelor degrees tends to have a  different attrition patterns which higher. May be they are moving to have a greener pasture.
  
### Attrition by Education:
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4b5ea1-b14f-4058-b27d-c2144261274a)
- Male and female employees exhibit slightly different attrition patterns. Exploring further could reveal if certain roles, job levels, or satisfaction metrics contribute to these differences.
  
## Work Experience and Tenure Analysis
### Objective: Assess employee tenure and promotion frequency.
### Approach:
- Calculate averages for YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, and YearsWithCurrManager to get insights into employee tenure.
- Pivot and filter by Attrition to see if shorter tenures correlate with higher turnover.
- Use Charts to illustrate the typical career progression (e.g., time between promotions or average years in current role) to help plan development initiatives.

### Attrition by Employee Tenure:
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4b5ea1-b14f-4058-b27d-c2144261274a)
- It was observed that employees with more than 10 years of service exhibit slightly different attrition patterns. In contrast, those with 1 to 10 years of tenure may not have fully established their footing within the organization, potentially leading to higher attrition rates.

### Attrition by Promotion Frequency:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4b5ea1-b14f-4058-b27d-c2144261274a)
  
- If employees promoted within the last five years exhibit higher attrition rates, it suggests that promotion might not necessarily be a factor driving them to leave.

## Formula Used
```   Formula:
Attrition Rate (%) = (Number of Employees Who Left / Total Number of Employees) × 100
```
- Age Grouping

    =CHOOSE(MATCH(A2,{0,19,35,50,65},1),"18 and Under","19-34","35-49","50-64","65 and Over")
  
- Attrition Encoded

    Find and Replace
  
- BusinessTravel Encoded

    =IF($E2="Travel_Rarely", 1, IF($E2="Travel_Frequently", 2, IF($E2="Non-Travel", 3,"")))
  
- Education

    =SWITCH(TRUE(),K2=1,"Below College",K2<=2,"College",K2=3,"Bachelor",K2=4, "Master","Doctor")
  
- JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction Encoded, Performance Rating, and Relationship Satisfaction

    =IFS(P2=1,"Low",P2=2,"Medium",P2=3,"High",P2=4,"Very High",TRUE," ")

## Tools and Methods Used

- Data Analysis: The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel, utilizing Pivot Tables to organize, summarize, and filter the data for easier interpretation.

- Data Visualization: Bar Charts were created in Excel to visually represent the key insights.

## Action Performed

- I put my data into a Table, removed all the formulaes by pasting real values and added it to a data model.
- I noticed my pivot Table was showing blank whereas i do not have any blank row; Solution applied was clean(trim(Cell))

## Dashboard
			
Total Number of Employees		Attrition Rate
	1470	                         16%
